                <p>When you get right down to it, success is all about value and trust.
                    Value is a product of trust.
                    The trust your clients have in you.
                    The trust you have in your people, strategies and systems. And the trust you have in your business advisors.
                    As the world's leading professional services firm, we know that value and trust are also the ingredients
                    of a quality relationship — and that they are earned over more than a single engagement.
                    No matter how big you are, public or private,
                    and in what industries or sectors you do business,
                    we can help you work smarter and reach your goals. Have a look at the services we offer, below. And let's talk.</p>

                            However, the images are coming out in more of a ellipse shape (see screenshot).
                            I don't see anything in the base Bootstrap CSS that I would need to adjust.
                            I've looked at a couple tutorials on this subject and none of them mention any extra tweaks.
                            Additionally, I've edited the size of the image to no avail. What am I doing wrong?

                            Therefore if the image is rectangular, you will generate an ellipse-like shape.
                            If you want to work around this, you would have to apply a mask over the image.
                            Alternatively, you could probably also clip it.

                    however, they should all be considered during the service definition process, and any “N/As” explained.</p>

                    and managing the service lifecycle - often in conjunction with a Service Team.</p>

                <p>A Service Manager mentor from ITS' CSS group generally orients the
                    Service Manager to IT Service Management tools and deliverables –
                    introduces the tools (listed below) and what they are used for.
                    Mentor and Service Manager identify which are applicable to the service.</p>
